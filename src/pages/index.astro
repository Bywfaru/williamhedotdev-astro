        `I am a ${age}-year-old **full-stack software engineer based in Vancouver, BC**, with a strong passion for web design and development.

I graduated from the **[British Columbia Institute of Technology](https://www.bcit.ca)** with a **diploma** in **[Computer Systems Technology (Web and Mobile Development option)](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-diploma-full-time-5500dipma/)** and am currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science** in **[Computer Science (Wireless and Mobile Applications option)](https://www.bcit.ca/programs/applied-computer-science-wireless-and-mobile-applications-development-option-bachelor-of-science-part-time-867fbsc/)**.

Since graduating, I have worked at [WaveBI](https://wavebi.com) for almost **three years** where I started as a **junior front-end web developer** then quickly filled a **lead front-end web developer** role.

With the combination of my education and professional experience, I am **confident** in my ability to make a **meaningful contribution** to your team.`,

        `I have almost **three years** of professional experience in web development, working with a variety of technologies. I have experience building **performant**, **responsive**, and **SEO-optimized** e-commerce sites using **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** and **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**. These sites leveraged **static generation**, **server-side rendering**, and **incremental static regeneration** to provide the best user experience possible. Additionally, custom **middleware** functions were created to handle **multivariate testing**.
        
My experience with front-end development also includes **payment processing** (using **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)**, **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com)**, and **[Authorize.Net](https://authorize.net)**) and **SEO-optimization** (by **dynamically-generating** **structured data in JSON-LD format** and **Open Graph metadata**).

Furthermore, I have experience implementing existing **headless CMS solutions** including as **[Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org)**, **[Strapi](https://strapi.io)**, and **[FireCMS](https://firecms.co)**, as well as developing **custom headless CMS solutions**.

While I have a strong foundation in **front-end development**, my experience extends to **back-end development** as well. I have written **RESTful APIs** using **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com)** for production applications and have experience with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** database technologies, such as **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** and **[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)**.
